#The only difference between docker-compose.yaml and this debug file is moving
#from Dockerfile "ENTRYPOINT"  into "command" of the compose file
#don't forget in compose run config set=true "--build/force build images"

#create a network and add our services into this network:
#so, "app" service will be able to connect to the mysql database from "db" service by the hostname="db":
#jdbc:mysql://db:3306/DOCKERDB?useSSL=false

#Connection url for connection in the DatabaseView:
#  jdbc:mysql://0.0.0.0:13306/DOCKERDB?useSSL=false, login=root, password=root
#App is available at: http://localhost:18080/entitybus/post
